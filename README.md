- Milkio allows users to add personalized captions or notes for each month, enhancing their ability to recall specific details or events related to their milk consumption during that period.
- The application ensures that data is stored reliably using IndexedDB, providing offline functionality and ensuring that users' records are consistently available, even without an internet connection.
- Milkio is designed with a focus on user experience, featuring an intuitive one-page application that is easy to navigate and use. The interface is clean, organized, and user-friendly.
